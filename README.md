# E-Oasis

E-Oasis is a web application that allows users to manage their e-books.
Users can search for books, add them to their library, and mark them as read/archived.

## Project goals

- Good UI/UX design: E-Oasis should be easy to use and visually appealing.
- Developer-friendly: The API should be user-friendly and well-documented, allowing users to easily develop applications based on the API themselves.
- Support for multiple formats: Support parsing various book formats (here parsing refers to extracting information from book covers or contents).
- Support uploading books: Users should be able to upload their own books to the platform.
- Support for multiple devices: Users should be able to sync their library across multiple devices.

### Non-goals:

- E-Oasis is not a book reader. It does not support reading books.
